Introducing my Netflix Clone project, crafted during my internship. Using HTML and CSS, I faithfully recreated the Netflix homepage, focusing on responsive design and accurate layout. Dive into the code to explore the implementation details and test its responsiveness across devices. This project reflects my dedication to mastering web development skills under the mentorship of Bharat Intern.
